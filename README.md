- 👋 Hi, I’m @TristanRast
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and its applictions for collaboration within storytelling; namely Tabletop RPG's
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python via Learning Python the Hard Way, Programming via Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs with guidance from Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A,
and developing small projects for daily life with core use cases via whatever materials I can find for the project. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently.
